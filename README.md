# In-Silico-Analysis-of-Dengue-Virus-NS5-Antiviral-Peptide
Data of mutation scans of antiviral peptides that can competitively bind to dengue virus 2 (DENV2) NS5

STAT2 is an essential protein to promote host innate immune response. Without STAT2, interferon signalling pathway responsible for protecting the host from viral infections is disrupted. DENV NS5 viral protein degrades STAT2 to establish an infection. So, peptides were designed to inhibit this protein-protein interaction.

Employing structure-based rationale design, peptides are derived from the human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2). The peptides designed is to inhibit the interaction of STAT2-DENV2 NS5 through competitive inhibition. 

Each amino acid residues at each position of the peptide is mutated into 20 canonical amino acids in protein. 
WT_Peptide 1 = 189-205 (17 a.a.)
