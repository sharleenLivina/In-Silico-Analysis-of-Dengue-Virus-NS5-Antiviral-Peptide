# In-Silico-Analysis-of-Dengue-Virus-2-NS5-Antiviral-Peptide

Computational saturated mutagenesis was performed using Python wrapper MutateX (https://github.com/ELELAB/mutatex)

Data of mutation scans of candidate wild type antiviral peptides that can competitively bind to dengue virus 2 (DENV2) NS5

STAT2 is an essential protein in promoting host innate immune response. Without STAT2, interferon signalling pathway responsible for protecting the host from viral infections is disrupted. DENV NS5 viral protein degrades STAT2 to establish an infection. So, peptides were designed to inhibit this protein-protein interaction.

Employing structure-based rationale design, peptides were derived from the human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2). The peptides were designed with the aim to inhibit STAT2-DENV2 NS5 interaction through competitive inhibition. 

Each amino acid residues at each position of the peptide is mutated into 20 canonical amino acids in protein. 

WT_Peptide 1 = 189-205 (17 a.a.)

WT_Peptide 2 = 206-219 (14 a.a.)

WT_Peptide 3 = 285-303 (19 a.a.)

Note:WT (wild type)
